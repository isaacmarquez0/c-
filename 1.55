Use String Methods to find information in the file:

  1) Find all the lines that start with "From:"
  2) Find all the lines that start with "To:"
  3) Find all the lines containing an email address.
     - Hint: Split the line into words and look for '@'.
  4) Find the oldest "Date" in the file.
     - Hint: Similar approach as #3.
