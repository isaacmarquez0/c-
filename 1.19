# Python TUPLES Lab1
print('''
Python Tuples - Introduction 
Like Lists, Tuples are comma delimited groups 
of variables
- Tuples are Immutable, which means you can't 
  change the values after they are created.
- Like Lists, you can Index Tuples.

Challenge #1
Run the code
- Can you explain the difference between a 
  List data structure and a Tuple data structure? 
- Read each line of code and explain how Indexing 
  work on both Lists and Tuples, then how assignments 
  work on Lists, but not on Tuples

my_list = [1, 2, "Cheese", 'and', 4]
my_tuple = (1,2,"Cheese", '&', 'Pickles')
print(my_list)
print(my_list[1])
print(my_list[2])
print(my_tuple)
print(my_tuple[1])
print(my_tuple[2])
my_list[0] = 5
my_list[4] = "Crackers"
print(my_list)
my_tuple = (1,2,"Cheese", '&', "Crackers",)

print(my_tuple)
